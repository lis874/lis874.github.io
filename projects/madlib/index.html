		<p> So, let me tell you about the time I met <span class="celeb"> </span>. </p>

		<p>
		One <span class="adj1"> </span> Sunday afternoon, I was getting ready to meet a friend at <span class="place"></span>. On my way to <span class="place"></span>, I walked past an art store, and the <span class="artsupply"></span> displaying behind the window caught my eyes. As I am looking at the <span class="artsupply"></span>, I trip over a <span class="noun1"> </span>, and fall to my face. I quickly get up from the floor, and soon realize that my <span class="body"> </span> is bleeding. I run into the closest CVS and picked up some band-aids.
		</p>

		<p>
		As I'm in the CVS, I suddenly realized that I needed to buy a <span class="noun2"> </span>. I look up and down the shelves and all I see are <span class="pnoun1"></span>, <span class="pnoun2"></span>, and <span class="pnoun3"></span>, but no <span class="noun2"> </span> to be found. As I am walking through the different aisles, I see a person <span class="verb"></span> down the aisle. The person turns and makes eye contact with me. Instantly I recognize the person. It's motherf---ing <span class="celeb"> </span>!!! 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		They quickly turned around and walked out the store. I immediately start following <span class="celeb"> </span> out of the store. I see them go into a restaurant, and I slowing followed behind. Luckily, the hostess seated me at the table behind <span class="celeb"> </span>. A waiter walks up to the table amd starts taking their order. 
		</p>

		<p>
		"Can I get a number <span class="number"></span>." 
		</p>

		<p>
		The waiter repeats, "Ok so that'll be a <span class="food"></span>". 
		</p>

		<p>
		Wow, imagine being so rich that you can order that many food. After a few minutes of awkward silence, I could no longer hold it in. I got up from my table and walked towards <span class="celeb"> </span>. 
		</p>

		<p>
		"Sorry to bother you, but are you <span class="celeb"> </span>?" 
		</p>

		<p>
		<span class="celeb"> </span> stares at with a blank look on their face and said, "No sorry, I'm <span class="artist"> </span>".
